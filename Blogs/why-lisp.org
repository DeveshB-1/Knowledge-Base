I started reading "Beating the Average" book. It began with a startup owner who wanted to develop things fast. He started searching different programs and stumbled upon the book "How to Become a Hacker" by Eric Raymond.

There he mentioned Lisp. He was curious about what Lisp was and explored it further.

Lisp led to macros - that's where true Lisp starts.

* What are Macros?

From my understanding, macros are a structure of code (skeleton) based on which code is generated. Macros can be powerful tools for code generation.

* Key Concepts

- **Homoiconicity**: Code as data and data as code
- **Macros**: Generate code rather than just execute functions
- **Syntax and Control Flow**: Lisp uses these to control abstract logic
