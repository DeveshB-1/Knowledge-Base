* Setup Steps

1. Docker engine installed
2. Ran hello world
3. =docker run ubuntu bash=

* Dockerfile Understanding

Dockerfile is a recipe for how the image is built:
- Base image → Set directory → Install requirements

* Docker Compose

Similar to Kubernetes YAML file - it's a blueprint for the whole system.

**Features**:
- Running complex setups
- Setting images
- Setting health checks
- Setting Redis volumes
- Automatic environment injection

* Docker Environment Benefits

- **Isolate packages**: Prevents conflicts
- **Runs with CUDA**: GPU support
- **Environment consistency**: Same environment across different systems

* Docker Image

A Docker image is a layered snapshot of a minimal Linux filesystem, including:
- Your app
- Its dependencies
- Configuration
- Everything needed to run the app in isolation
