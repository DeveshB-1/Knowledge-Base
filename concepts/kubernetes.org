* Kubernetes Basics

**Minikube**:
Lightweight single-node Kubernetes cluster that has both control plane components and worker node components.

In kubeadm, commonly deployed on VMs to simulate multi-node Kubernetes, but modern Minikube uses container-based drivers, reducing the need for dedicated VMs on local setups.

* Basic Commands

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Get nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Create pod with nginx image
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

# Delete pod
kubectl delete pod my-pod
#+END_SRC

* Pod Definition

**Repeatability** is key. Pod definition example:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
#+END_SRC

* API Server

Acts as front door for cluster:
- Handles architecture
- Admission control
- Returns current state to clients

* Pod Characteristics

Pods are ephemeral objects which can't be paused. To stop a pod means we need to delete the pod.

* ReplicaSet
