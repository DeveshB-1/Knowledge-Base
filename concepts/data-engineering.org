* Data Types

- **Structured Data**: Organized, tabular format
- **Unstructured Data**: Raw, non-tabular format

* Why Data Engineering?

Data engineers handle the complete data lifecycle and infrastructure.

* Data Engineer Lifecycle

**1. Generation**
- Data creation and collection

**2. Traditional Stage and IoT**
- Traditional data processing
- Internet of Things data handling

**3. Callback and Hook**
- Event-driven data processing

* Key Technologies

**FastAI (Jeremy Howard)**:
- Machine learning framework

**BLOB (Binary Large Object)**:
- Storage for large binary data

* Docker in Data Engineering

"It works on my computer" → Docker solves this problem

**Docker Architecture**:
- Docker client (for instructions) → Docker daemon/host
- Example: =docker run -t nginx latest=

* Data Pipeline Concepts

- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Data storage
- Data serving
