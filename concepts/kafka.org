* What is Kafka?

Streamlined data pipeline for real-time data processing.

**Core Components**:
- **Producer API**: Records data → saved as immutable topics stored in cluster (brokers)
- **Multiple Consumers**: Can subscribe to the data
- **Stream API**: Powerful API that can transform topics in real-time

* Kafka vs RabbitMQ

**Kafka**:
- Sent to services → streams data to services
- Producer decides which queue data should go to
- Enables Kafka to handle large amounts of data
- Higher throughput compared to RabbitMQ

**RabbitMQ**:
- Consumer knows what kind of message they are consuming
- More traditional message queuing approach

* Key Benefits

- High throughput
- Real-time data transformation
- Immutable data storage
- Multiple consumer support
- Scalable architecture
